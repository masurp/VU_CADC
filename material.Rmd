## Preparation

#### Install R and RStudio

Before the first practical session (2nd of November), please make sure that you have R and Rstudio installed on your computer and have played around a little with it (it is open source and free to use!). Please work through the initial steps outlined in this worksheet:

- [Installing R and RStudio](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/blob/master/tutorials/R_basics_1_getting_started_short.md). 

#### Familiarize yourself with the course

Lectures are every *Monday* (online; see overview for exact dates and times). In these lectures, a particular research problem will be introduced and we will discuss methodological solutions. We will get to know respective computational methods and contextualize them within the broader research process. We expect you to:

- Think, participate, discuss
- Ask questions!

Practical sessions are every *Tuesday* and *Thursday* (partly online, partly on campus; see overview for exact dates and times). For the practical sessions, the class will be split into 5 groups of equal size (this will happen in the first lecture). In these practical sessions, we will work with RStudio and ran analyses on real-world data sets. We therefore engage in various data analytic exercises. We expect you to: 

- Bring your computer
- Run the scripts and work through the code 
- Ask questions!

In the third cycle, students will work on their own research projects. Resources and material for additional methods and statistical approaches will be provided to all students.

#### Homework

- Add two music reviews to the following google sheet (before Monday 17:00)
    - In the coming week, we would like to work with some (text) data that we have produced ourselves. So as a small homework, I would like to ask you to add (at least) two reviews to this data set. Please fill in the columns for one music album that you really like (e.g., your favorite album by your favorite music artist) and one for an album that you were slightly disappointed by or even did not like at all (I already provided some examples). If you don't mind disclosing, please also add your name (if not use a nickname). We will explore this data visually as well.
