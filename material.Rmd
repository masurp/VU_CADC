## Preparation

#### Install R and RStudio

Before the first practical session, please make sure that you have R and Rstudio installed on your computer and have played around a little with it (it is open source and free to use). Please work through the initial steps outlined in these two worksheets:

- [Installing R and RStudio](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/blob/master/tutorials/R_basics_1_getting_started_short.md). 
- [R Basics](https://github.com/masurp/VU_CADC/blob/main/tutorials/R_basics_introduction.md)

#### Familiarize yourself with the course

Lectures are every *Monday* from 9-10.45 (see [overview](overview.html) for exact dates and times). In these lectures, a particular research problem will be introduced and we will discuss methodological solutions. We will get to know respective computational methods and contextualize them within the broader research process. Practical sessions are every **Tuesday* and *Thursday* between 9-10.45 or 11-12.45 (again see [overview](overview.html) for exact dates and times). For the practical sessions, the class will be split into 5-6 groups of equal size. In these practical sessions, we will work with RStudio and ran analyses on real-world data sets. We therefore engage in various data analytic exercises. We expect you to: 

- Bring your own computer
- Run the scripts and work through the code 
- Ask questions and participate!

In the third part of the course, students will work on their own research projects. Resources and material for additional methods and statistical approaches will be provided to all students.
