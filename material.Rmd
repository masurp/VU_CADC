### Preparation

#### Install R and RStudio

Before the first practical session (2nd of November), please make sure that you have R and Rstudio installed on your computer and have played around a little with it (it is open source and free to use!). Please work through the initial steps outlined in this worksheet:

- [Installing R and RStudio](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material/blob/master/tutorials/R_basics_1_getting_started_short.md). 

#### Familiarize yourself with the course

Lectures are every Monday from 9:00 to 11:15 (on campus!). In these lectures, a particular "research problem" will be introduced and we will discuss potential (methodological) solutions. We will get to know respective computational methods and contextualize them within the broader research process. We expect you to:

- Think, participate, discuss
- Ask questions!

Practical sessions are every Tuesday and Thursday (on campus!), either form 9:00 to 10:30 (3 parallel courses) or from 11:00 to 12:30 (3 parallel courses). For the practical sessions, the class will be split into 6 groups of equal size (this will happen in the first lecture). In these practical sessions, we will work with RStudio and ran analyses on real-world data sets. We therefore engage in various data analytical exercises. We expect you to: 

- Bring your computer
- Run the scripts and work through the code 
- Ask questions!

In the third cycle, students have the possibility to choose a certain specialization (between three alternatives). Material for *ALL* alternatives will be provided to all students. We encourage you to also engage with the material from other specializations!
