## Introduction: Grouping and Summarizing

The functions used in the earlier tutorial on data preparation worked on individual rows.
In many cases, you need to compute properties of groups of rows (cases).

For example, you might want to know the average age per group of respondents,
or the total number of votes for a party based on data per region.

This is called aggregation (or summarization) and in tidyverse uses the `group_by` function
followed by either `summarize` or `mutate`. 

This tutorial will explain how these functions work and how they can be used for data summarization.

### The role of grouping

When we summarize data, we generally want to summarize some value per group of rows.
For this reason, the process in R consists of two steps.

For this example, assume we have individual-level survey data with gender and age per respondent:

![Data to summarize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/summarize1.png)

First, you define the groups by which you want to summarize.
In this case, we want two groups (for male and female), but of course in other cases there can be many more groups. The result of *grouping* is a very similar data frame, but in this case the groups are explicitly marked: 

![Grouped data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/summarize2.png)

Now, the second step is to compute the summary statistics per group. For example, we could compute the average age for each group:

![Summarized data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanatteveldt/ccslearnr/master/data/summarize3.png)

In R, summarization also follows the same steps, with `group_by` used for creating the groups (without changing the data), and `summarize` used for computing the summary statistics and creating the resulting frame containing the summarized data.

In the next section, we will look at these commands in detail. 



## Before we start: Pipelines and the |> symbol

In Tidyverse, often you run many data cleaning or transformation commands in sequence.
For example, you might want to read in data, select some columns, filter some rows,
mutate a new calue, and summarize some other values. 

If we would do this with single commands, we would get a very repetitive script.
For example, 

```{r pipe1}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/poll-quiz-guns/guns-polls.csv"
polls <- read_csv(url)
polls <- filter(polls, Question == "age-21")
polls <- select(polls, Population, Pollster, Support)
polls <- mutate(polls, Percent = Support / 100)
```

The code above runs fine, but as you can see it repeats the name `polls` an awful lot. 
Because this is such a common pattern, R has introduced a shortcut to express such a sequence, or **pipeline**,
of operations: The pipeline operator `|>`. 

This operator works by chaining together multiple functions, such that the output of the first function is the input
(first argument) of the second functoin. To see this in action, the following snippet can be rewritten as a pipeline like this:

```{r pipe2}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/poll-quiz-guns/guns-polls.csv"
polls <- read_csv(url) |>
  filter(Question == "age-21") |>
  select(Population, Pollster, Support) |>
  mutate(Percent = Support / 100)
```

The whole sequence of calls is now a single statement ('sentence'), where the result of `read_csv` is the input of `filter`, the result of which is fed into `select`, etc., until the output of `mutate` is assigned to the polls variable.

This technique is very convenient to group related calls together, 
and can make code more readable by making it clear that such a group of calls is a logical unit.

The biggest **common mistake** is that you no longer supply the data to the functions in the pipeline (except the first), so instead of using `filter(data, ...) |> select(data, ...)` make sure you use  `filter(data, ...) |> select( ...)`. Note that you can also feed the data into the first function, like `data |> filter(...)`. 

Whether you use pipelines or not yourself is a stylistic choice, but it's important to be able to read them as they are often used in scripts (including this tutorial).
Note that older code might use the `%>%` symbol, which was around longer and has the same function. 

### Pipelines: exercise

Can you rewrite the calls from `read_csv` to `mutate` into a single pipeline?


```{r pipe3, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/poll-quiz-guns/guns-polls.csv"
gunpolls <- read_csv(url)
gunpolls <- select(gunpolls, Question, Support, 
                   rep=`Republican Support`, dem=`Democratic Support`)
gunpolls <- mutate(gunpolls, diff = rep - dem)
head(gunpolls)
```

**Solution:**

```{r pipe3-solution}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/poll-quiz-guns/guns-polls.csv"
gunpolls <- read_csv(url) |>
 select(Question, Support, 
        rep=`Republican Support`, dem=`Democratic Support`) |>
  mutate(diff = rep - dem) 
head(gunpolls)
```



## Summarizing data in R

Let's look at how we can we summarize data in R:

### Data

First, let's fire up tidyverse and load the gun polls data used in the earlier example:

```{r pollsdata, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/poll-quiz-guns/guns-polls.csv"
polls <- read_csv(url) |>
  select(Question, Population, Pollster, Support)
```


```{r showpolls, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/poll-quiz-guns/guns-polls.csv"
polls <- read_csv(url) |>
  select(Question, Population, Pollster, Support)
polls
```
```
# A tibble: 57 × 5
   Question     Pollster           Support   Rep   Dem
   <chr>        <chr>                <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
 1 age-21       CNN/SSRS                72    61    86
 2 age-21       NPR/Ipsos               82    72    92
 3 age-21       Rasmussen               67    59    76
 ```
 
### Grouping rows

Now, we can use the group_by function to group by, for example, Question:

```{r groupby, eval=F}
polls |> group_by(Question)
```
```
# A tibble: 57 × 5
# Groups:   Question [8]
   Question     Pollster           Support   Rep   Dem
   <chr>        <chr>                <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
 1 age-21       CNN/SSRS                72    61    86
 2 age-21       NPR/Ipsos               82    72    92
 3 age-21       Rasmussen               67    59    76
 4 age-21       Harris Interactive      84    77    92
 5 age-21       Quinnipiac              78    63    93
 [...]
```


As you can see, the data itself didn't actually change yet, it merely recorded (at the top) that we are now grouping by Question,
and that there are 8 groups (different questions) in total. 

::: Info ::::::
The grouping information created by `group_by` is recorded on the data frame, and will stay intact until you `group_by` on a different variable. You can also remove grouping information using the `ungroup()` function.  
:::

### Summarization functions


An important consideration here is that the function used should be a *summarization function*, that is, a function that summarizes a group of values to a single value. 
An example summarization function is `mean`, which computes the mean (average) of a group of values:

```{r sum, exercise=TRUE}
values = c(1,2,3)
mean(values)
```


Other useful functions are for example `sum`, `max` and `min`. 

Can you change the code above to compute the `sum` rather than the mean of values?

### Summarizing data

Now, we are ready to use `summarize` to create the summarized data frame.

This function is similar to `mutate` in the sense that we specify how to compute the new columns using `name=function(column)` arguments.

```{r summarize, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='pollsdata'}
polls |> group_by(Question) |> summarize(Support=mean(Support))
```

**Solution:**

```{r summarize-solution}
polls |> group_by(Pollster) |> summarize(Support=max(Support))
```

**Exercise**: Alter the code above to compute the highest level of support (i.e. max support) per pollster

## Using mutate on grouped data

The previous section used `group_by(col1) |> summarize(name=fn(col2))`. 
As you could see, this creates a new and often much smaller 'summarized' data frame,
with one row per unique group and only keeps the grouping column(s) and the calculated column(s).

Instead of `summarize`, you can also run `mutate` with summarization functions on grouped data.
In that case, the summary is computer per group, but instead of replacing the data frame with only the summarized data, the new column is added to the existing data frame, with the values repeated within a group:

```{r mutate, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='pollsdata'}
polls |> group_by(Question) |> mutate(Mean_Support=mean(Support))
```

This can be very useful to compute the relation between single values and e.g. the group averages. 

**Exercise:** Can you create a new column `difference`, that shows to what extend an individual poll is higher or lower than the group average? E.g. for the first row, the result would be (approximately) `72 - 75.9 = -3.9`.

```{r mutate2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='pollsdata', eval=FALSE}
polls |> group_by(Question) |> mutate(Mean_Support=mean(Support), difference=____)
```

**Solution:**

```{r mutate2-solution}
polls |> group_by(Question) |> mutate(Mean_Support=mean(Support), difference=Support - Mean_Support)
```



::: Info ::::::
In `mutate`, if you compute two variables, you can already use the first value in the second computation: R will do the computations one by one. 
:::

## Computing multiple summary values

The previous examples all grouped by a single variable and then computed a single summary value.
It is also possible to compute multiple values in a single call.

The snippet below shows how you can compute the mean and standard deviation (`sd`) of the Support per question. It also uses the function `n()` (without argument) to compute the number of cases per question. 

```{r summarize-multiple, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="pollsdata"}
polls |> 
  group_by(Question) |> 
  summarize(mean=mean(Support), sd=sd(Support), n=n())
```

### Exercise: Z-scores

In statistics, the z-score or normalized value of a variable is it's number of standard deviations from the mean. 
For example, In the poll from CNN support from age-21 was 72%. 
As you can see above, the mean support for that question was about 76%, and the standard deviation was about 6 percentage points. So, the CNN polls was about 0.67 standard deviations lower than the average: it's z-score is -0.67. 

Can you compute the z-score for all polls?
To do this, you can start from the code above but use mutate rather than summarize to compute the mean and standard deviation per question. 
Then, you compute the new column by comparing the Support for that question to the computed mean.

```{r zscore, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='pollsdata'}
polls |>
  group_by(Question) |>
  mutate(mean=mean(Support),  sd=sd(Support))
```

**Solution:**

```{r zscore-solution}
polls |>
  group_by(Question) |>
  mutate(mean=mean(Support),  sd=sd(Support)) |>
  mutate(zscore = (Support - mean) / sd)
```


You can first just run the snippet above to see how the data looks. Then, add a second `mutate` command to compute a new column called `zscore`.


(Note that you can also include the new computation in the first mutate call if desired,
but it is a bit more readable to create a new mutate to differentiate the group level and individual level computations.)`\

## Grouping by multiple columns

In the `group_by` function, you can also specify multiple columns.
For example, the code below computes the average by question and by populuation category.

```{r group-multiple, eval=F}
polls |> group_by(Question, Population) |> summarize(Support=mean(Support))
```
```
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Question'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
# A tibble: 15 × 3
# Groups:   Question [8]
   Question                    Population        Support
   <chr>                       <chr>               <dbl>
 1 age-21                      Adults               74.5
 2 age-21                      Registered Voters    76.4
 3 arm-teachers                Adults               42.7
 4 arm-teachers                Registered Voters    41.3
 [...]
```

As you can see, the result is a data set with one row per unique group, that is, ther question - population combination.
In the message above the output, and in the output itself, you can also see that the result it itself grouped by Question. 
When summarizing data with multiple grouping value, R by default removes the last grouping column, so instead of Question and Population it's now just grouped by Question. 

This behaviour can be quite useful if you want to compute new statistics for the remaining groups.
Note that you can remove this grouping either by either adding `.groups=drop', or by calling the function `|> ungroup()` on the result.

### Exercise: deviations from group means

Starting from the code above, and taking into account that after the summarize function the data is grouped by question, can you calculate the deviation from the average support per population within each question? So, the adults are `-0.95` point away from the average support for age-21: the average support for age-21 is `75.4`, and `74.5 - 75.4 = -0.95`.

```{r group-multiple-ex, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup='pollsdata', eval=FALSE}
polls |> 
  group_by(Question, Population) |> 
  summarize(Support=mean(Support)) |> 
  mutate(mean_support=____, deviation=____)
```

**Solution:**


```{r group-multiple-ex-solution}
polls |> 
  group_by(Question, Population) |> 
  summarize(Support=mean(Support)) |> 
  mutate(mean_support=mean(Support), deviation=Support - mean_support)
```
