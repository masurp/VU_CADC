This tutorial teaches the basics of data visualization using the `ggplot2` package (included in the `tidyverse`). 
For more information, see [R4DS Chapter 3: Data Visualization](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and  [R4DS Chapter 7: Exploratory Data Analysis](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html).

For *many* cool visualization examples using `gplot2` (with R code included!) see the [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/portfolio/ggplot2-package/).
For inspiration (but unfortunately no R code), there is also a [538 blog post on data visualization from 2016](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-52-best-and-weirdest-charts-we-made-in-2016/).
Finally, see the article on '[the grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html)' published by Hadley Wickham for more insight into the ideas behind ggplot.


# A basic ggplot plot

## Loading packages and data

Suppose that we want to see the relation between college education and household income, both included in the `county facts` subset published by [Houston Data Visualisation github page](https://github.com/houstondatavis/data-jam-august-2016). 

(If you want to practice downloading a data set into a folder and loading it from there: you can find the data set on Canvas as well. Bear in mind to set the working directory correctly).  

```{r}
# Load package collection
library(tidyverse)

# Download data
csv_folder_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/houstondatavis/data-jam-august-2016/master/csv"  # URL to folder 
facts <- read_csv(paste(csv_folder_url, "county_facts.csv", sep = "/")) # pasting folder path and file name together
facts
```

Since this data set contains a large amount of columns, we keep only a subset of columns for now:

```{r}
# Selecting columns and filtering 
facts_state <- facts %>% 
  select(fips, area_name, state_abbreviation, 
         population = Pop_2014_count, 
         pop_change = Pop_change_pct,
         over65 = Age_over_65_pct, 
         female = Sex_female_pct,
         white = Race_white_pct,
         college = Pop_college_grad_pct, 
         income = Income_per_capita) %>%
  filter(is.na(state_abbreviation) & fips != 0) %>% 
  select(-state_abbreviation)

# Check results
facts_state
```

## Building a layered visualization

Now, let's make a simple *scatter plot* with percentage college-educated on the x-axis and median income on the y-axis. First, we can used the function `ggplot` to create an empty canvas tied to the dataset `facts_state` and tell the function which variables to use:

```{r}
ggplot(data = facts_state,        ## which data set?
       aes(x=college, y=income))  ## which variables as aesthetics?
```

Next, we need to tell ggplot what to plot. In this case, we want to produce a scatterplot. The function `geom_point` adds a layer of information to the canvas. In the language of ggplot, each layer has a *geometrical representation*, in this case "points". In this case, the "x" and "y" are mapped to the college and income columns.

```{r}
ggplot(data = facts_state,
       mapping = aes(x = college, y = income)) + 
  geom_point()   ## adding the geometrical representation
```

The result is a plot where each point here represents a state, and we see a clear correlation between education level and income. There is one clear outlier on the top-right. Can you guess which state that is?

So called *aesthetic mappings*, which map the visual elements of the geometry to columns of the data, can also be included as argument in the `geom` itself and not in the `ggplot()?` command. This can be handy when several `geoms` are plotted and different aesthetics are used. 
For example, we can add more `geoms` to the plot (e.g., a regression line). If we provided the aesthetics within the `ggplot`-function, these are passed automatically to the following `geoms`.

```{r}
# Linear regression line
ggplot(data = facts_state, 
       mapping = aes(x = college, y = income)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


## Important note on ggplot command syntax

For the plot to work, R needs to execute the whole ggplot call and all layers as a single statement.
Practically, that means that if you combine a plot over multiple lines, the plus sign needs to be at the end of the line, so R knows more is coming. 

So, the following is good:

```{r}
ggplot(data = facts_state,
       mapping = aes(x = college, y = income)) + 
  geom_point()
```

But this is not:

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot(data = facts_state,
       mapping = aes(x = college, y = income)) 
  + geom_point()
```

We can also move the mappings to the `geom`. This can be useful when we want to plot different `geoms` based on different variables. 

```{r}
# same as above
ggplot(data = facts_state) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = college, y = income))
```

Also note that the data and mapping arguments are always the first arguments the functions expect, so you can also call them implicitly:

```{r}
ggplot(facts_state) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = college, y = income))
```


## Other aesthetics  

To find out which visual elements can be used in a layer, use e.g. `?geom_point`. According to the help file, we can (among others) set the colour, alpha (transparency), and size of points.
Let's first set the size of points to the population of each state, creating a bubble plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = facts_state) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = college, y = income, size = population))
```

Since it is difficult to see overlapping points, let's make all points somewhat transparent. 
Note: Since we want to set the alpha of all points to a single value, this is not a mapping (as it is not mapped to a column from the data frame), but a constant.
These are set outside the mapping argument:

```{r}
ggplot(data = facts_state) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = college, y = income, size = population), 
             alpha = .5, 
             colour = "red")
```

Instead of setting colour to a constant value, we can also let it vary with the data. For example, we can colour the states by percentage of population above 65:

```{r}
ggplot(data = facts_state) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = college, y = income, size = population, colour = over65), 
             alpha = .9)
```

Finally, you can map to a categorical value as well. 
Let's categorize states into whether population is growing (at least 1%) or stable or declining.
We use the `if_else(condition, iftrue, iffalse)` function, which assigns the `iftrue` value if the condition is true, and `iffalse` otherwise:

```{r}
# Creating a new variable
facts_state <- facts_state %>% 
  mutate(growth = ifelse(pop_change > 1, "Growing", "Stable"))

# Plotting a categorical variable
ggplot(data=facts_state) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = college, y = income, size = population, colour = growth), 
             alpha=.9)
```

As you can see in these examples, ggplot tries to be smart about the mapping you ask.
It automatically sets the x and y ranges to the values in your data.
It mapped the size such that there are small and large points, but not e.g. a point so large that it would dominate the graph.
For the colour, for interval variables it created a colour scale, while for a categorical variable it automatically assigned a colour to each group.

Of course, each of those choices can be customized, and sometimes it makes a lot of sense to do so.
For example, you might wish to use red for republicans and blue for democrats, if your audience is used to those colors; or you may wish to use grayscale for an old-fashioned paper publication.
We'll explore more options in a later tutorial, but for now let's be happy that ggplot does a lot of work for us!


**Exercise 1:** Of course there are more types of plots. Try to plot a so-called "histogram" of the variable `income`. Histograms are really helpful to understand the distribution of a variable. Tip: Check out the help page by calling `?geom_histogram`. The first example will help you build the right plot. In a second step, simply exchange `geom_histogram()` with `geom_density()`. What do you see now?

```{r}
# Solution here
```


# Bar plots

Another frequently used plot is the bar plot. 
By default, R bar plots assume that you want to plot a histogram, e.g. the number of occurences of each group.
As a very simple example, the following plots the number of states that are growing or stable in population:

```{r}
ggplot(data = facts_state) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = growth))
```

For a more interesting plot, let's plot the votes per Republican candidate in the New Hampshire primary.
First, we need to download the per-county data, summarize it per state, and filter to only get the NH results for the Republican party:
(see the previous tutorials on [Data Transformations](R-tidy-5-transformation.md) and [Joining data](R-tidy-13a-joining.md) for more information if needed)

```{r}
# Getting new data
results_state <- read_csv(paste(csv_folder_url, "primary_results.csv", sep = "/")) %>% 
  group_by(state, party, candidate) %>% 
  summarize(votes=sum(votes))

# Subset of New Hampshire and republican candidates
nh_gop <- results_state %>% 
  filter(state == "New Hampshire" & party == "Republican")
nh_gop
```

Now, let's make a bar plot with votes (y) per candidate (x). Since we don't want ggplot to summarize it for us (we already did that ourselves), we set `stat="identity"` to set the grouping statistic to the identity function, i.e. just use each point as it is.

```{r}
# We can also store parts of a plot in an object
plot1 <- ggplot(nh_gop) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=candidate, y=votes), 
           stat='identity')
plot1
```

## Setting graph options

Some options, like labels, legends, and the coordinate system are graph-wide rather than per layer. You add these options to the graph by adding extra functions to the call.
For example, we can use coord_flip() to swap the x and y axes:

```{r}
plot1 + 
  coord_flip()
```

You can also reorder categories with the `reorder` function, for example to sort by number of votes. Also, let's add some colour (just because we can!):

```{r}
ggplot(nh_gop) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(candidate, votes), y = votes, fill = candidate), 
           stat = 'identity') + 
  coord_flip()
```

This is getting somewhere, but the x-axis label (y-axis after rotation) is not very pretty and we don't need guides for the fill mapping. This can be remedied by more graph-level options.
Also, we can use a `theme` to alter the appearance of the graph, for example using the minimal theme:

```{r}
ggplot(nh_gop) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(candidate, votes), y = votes, fill = candidate), 
           stat = 'identity') + 
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Candidate") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Grouped bar plots

We can also add groups to bar plots. 
For example, we can set the x category to state (taking only NH and IA to keep the plot readable), and then group by candidate:

```{r}
gop2 <- results_state %>% 
  filter(party == "Republican" & (state == "New Hampshire" | state == "Iowa")) 

ggplot(gop2) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = state, y = votes, fill = candidate), 
           stat='identity')
```

By default, the groups are stacked. This can be controlled with the position parameter, which can be `dodge` (for grouped bars) or `fill` (stacking to 100%):

```{r}
ggplot(gop2) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=state, y=votes, fill=candidate), 
           stat='identity', 
           position='dodge')
ggplot(gop2) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=state, y=votes, fill=candidate), 
           stat='identity', 
           position='fill')
```


# Line plots

Finally, another frequent graph is the line graph. 
For example, we can plot the ascendancy of Donald Trump by looking at his vote share over time. 
First, we combine the results per state with the primary schedule: (see the tutorial on [Joining data](R-tidy-13a-joining.md))

```{r}
# dataset 1
schedule  <- read_csv(paste(csv_folder_url, "primary_schedule.csv", sep="/")) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format="%m/%d/%y"))
schedule

# dataset 2
trump <- results_state %>% 
  group_by(state, party) %>% 
  mutate(vote_prop=votes/sum(votes)) %>% 
  filter(candidate=="Donald Trump")
trump

# join the two data sets (more next sessions)
trump <- left_join(trump, schedule) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(vote_prop = mean(vote_prop))
trump
```

Take a minute to inspect the code above, and try to understand what each line does! 
The best way to do this is to inspect the output of each line, and trace back how that output is computed based on the input data.

```{r}
ggplot(trump) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = vote_prop))
```

# Multiple 'faceted' plots

Just to show off some of the possibilities of ggplot, let's make a plot of all republican primary outcomes on Super Tuesday (March 1st):

```{r}
super <- results_state %>% 
  left_join(schedule) %>% 
  filter(party == "Republican" & date == "2016-03-01") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  mutate(vote_prop = votes/sum(votes))

ggplot(super) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = candidate, y = vote_prop), 
           stat = 'identity') + 
  facet_wrap(~state, nrow = 3) + 
  coord_flip()
```

Note ~facet_wrap~ wraps around a single facet. You can also use ~facet_grid() to specify separate variables for rows and columns.

**Exercise 2:** How could we change the plot to color the bars according to the candidates? 

```{r}
# Solution here
```

# Themes

Customization of things like background colour, grid colour etc. is handled by themes. 
`ggplot` has two built-in themes: `theme_grey` (default) and `theme_bw` (for a more minimal theme with white background). 
The package ggthemes has some more themes, including an 'economist' theme (based on the newspaper).
To use a theme, simply add it to the plot:

```{r}
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(trump) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = vote_prop)) + 
  theme_economist() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Percentage that voted for Trump")
```
