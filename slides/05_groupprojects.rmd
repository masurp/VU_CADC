# What was this course about?

Recap and overview.


---

# A General Text Classification Pipeline

![](img/text_analysis_fundamentals/Slide01.png)



# Example: Political migration discourse on Facebook 


1. **Obtaining Text**: Scraping data from Facebook and importing it into R

2. **Feature Enginieering:** Removing noise, summarizing data to creating a tidy data set, transforming the data into a document-feature matrix 

3. **Text classification:** Run a sentiment analysis to classify the tweets (using a dictionary approach)

4. **Validation:** Assessing the classification result against a gold-standard


. . .


5. **Substantive Analysis**: Predicting sentiment towards migration with party ideology

6. **Visualize**: Plotting the relationship between sentiment and party ideology with ggplot2

7. **Communicate**: Creating a table and figure and report results in the paper

# What happens now?

Small group research projects

---

# Research projects

- We create small working groups (4 students per group)

- You will conduct your own research projects
    
    - Obtaining data
    - Preparing, coding, transforming....
    - Visualizing
    - Testing assumptions/hypotheses
    
- Teachers will supervise your progress and support you during practical sessions

- At the end, you will present your findings in a "online"-conference (20th of December)

---

# How will the supervision work?

- Each group will be assigned to a) a teacher (Kasper, Paulina, or Philipp) and b) a particular time slot (during the usual practical session times)

- You will have 15 minute time slots with your supervisor on the 7th, 9th, 14th and 16th of December

- In the first supervision session, you will explore ideas and find a topic

- In the following sessions, we expect you to come prepared:

    - Have concrete questions
    - Have the analysis up and running on your computer, so that we can help with problems
    
    
---

# Final presentation at the "mini-conference"

- Time and Date: 20th December from 9:00 to 11:30

    - There will be three parallel sessions
    - More information soon (including exact schedule)

- You will give a 10-minute talk (including appropriate slides) in which you:

    - introduce the research project (1-2 slides)
    - describe theory and hypotheses (1 slide)
    - explain the methods (1 slide)
    - present the results (2 slides)
    - discuss the findings (1-2 slides)

- You are required to hand in the RMarkdown, a compiled html output, and the slides beforehand (Sharp Deadline: 19th of December 2021 at 24:00)!

You are further required to create one summary poster that we will post on the course website (example will be provided on Canvas)

# Let's build groups!


---

# Canvas

- Please go to Canvas

- You can assign yourself to a group (max 4 people)

- In the end, I will put remaining people randomly into the groups with open places

- **Note:** Please only build groups with people from groups that have the same time slot (otherwise your supervision will be in at a different time than the practical sessions!):

    - Group 1, 3, & 5 
    - Group 2 & 4

- Go!

# Inspiration

Some ideas for your research projects

# Where to get data?

- Publicly repositories of research data sets

   - http://gesis.org (Archive for social sciences)
   - http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/ (World Value Survey)
   - http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/data/ (European Social Survey)
   - http://www.pewglobal.org/category/datasets/ (Pew Institute)
   
- Other public repositories

   - https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
   - http://www.kaggle.com
   - Many further online repositories...

- More data:

   - Your supervisor might also have data that suits your needs!
   - Some of the data sets used in class may be interesting to reanalyze


---

# Where to get data?

- Scraping primary sources
  - Press releases from party website
  - Existing archives
  - Scraping Tweets from Twitter

- Proprietary texts from third parties:
  - digital archives (LexisNexis, factiva, etc.)
  - social media APIs

---

# Important aspects

1. Try to formulate an appropriate research question that can be studied with the respective data set, text documents, tweets,...

2. Formulate hypothesis using theory and relevant literature

3. Test scales before using them

4. Engage in descriptive analyses

5. Visualize data

6. Test assumptions if necessary

7. Put an emphasis on correctly report and interpret your results
