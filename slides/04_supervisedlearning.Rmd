# Machine Learning?

# What are we actually talking about?

- Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.

- Due to the "black box" nature of the algorithm's operations, it is often seen as a form of artificial intelligence. 

- Key idea: machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

- Machine learning is used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine (e.g., pattern detection), email filtering (e.g., spam detection), speech recognition, and computer vision.

# The problem: What has this to do with text analysis?

- A common task in communication science involves hand-labeling sets of documents for specific variables (e.g. manual coding)

- In the past, this required hiring research assistants and training them to read and evaluate text by hand

- Disadvantages: It was expensive, prone to error, required extensive data quality checks, and was unfeasible if you had an extremely large corpus of texts

# Enter machine learning!

We can now use machine learning models to classify text into specific sets of categories. This is known as **supervised learning**. The basic process is:

<br>

**1.** Hand-code a small set of documents (say N = 1,000) for whatever variable(s) you care about

**2.** Train a machine learning model on the hand-coded data, using the variable as the outcome of interest and the text features of the documents as the predictors

**3.** Evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning model via cross-validation

**4.** Once you have trained a model with sufficient predictive accuracy, apply the model to the remaining set of documents that have never been hand-coded (say N = 100,000)
