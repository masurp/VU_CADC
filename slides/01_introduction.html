...and why does it matter to us?

# Harnessing surprising sources of information

.pull-left[
- In 2009, Blumenstock and colleagues (2015, Science) wanted to study wealth and poverty in Rwanda. 
- They conducted a survey with a random sample of 1,000 customers of the largest mobile phone provider
- They collected demographics, social, and economic characteristics 
- Traditional social science survey, right?
]

.pull-right[
- The authors also had access to complete call records from 1.5 million people
- Combining both data sources, they used the survey data to "train" a machine learning model to predict a person's wealth based on their call records.
- They also estimated the places of residence based on the geographic information embedded in call records. 
]

# Example: Wealth in Rwanda

.pull-left[
![](img/Blumenstock_et_al_Rwanda.png)
]

.pull-right[

- All together, they were able to produce a high-resolution map of the geographic distribution of wealth in Rwanda.
- Problem: Results were hard to validate - there were simply no comparable estimates for all geographic areas in Rwanda

# Better prediction

.pull-right[

- Already years ago, police departments have started to a system called CRUSH (Criminal Reduction Utilizing Statistical History) 
- It evaluates patterns of past and present crime incidents and combines it with a range of data including crime reports, offender behavior profiles, weather forecasts...
- This combination of data is then used to predict potential hot spots and flashpoints and allocate resources to areas where particular crimes are most likely to occur.


]

---

# Why is this important now?

- In the past, collecting data was expensive (surveys, observations...)
- In the digital age, the behaviors of billions of people are recorded, stored, and therefore analyzable
- For example, every time you click on a website, make a call on your mobile phone, or pay for something with your credit card, a digital record of your behavior is created and stored 
- Because (meta-)data are a byproduct of people’s everyday actions, they are often called **digital traces**. 
- Governments also have incredibly rich data about both people and businesses
- Large-scale records of persons or business are often called **big data**.

# Computational Communication Science

A definition.

---

# Definition

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "Computational Communication Science (CCS) is the label applied to the 
&gt; emerging subfield that investigates the use of computational algorithms 
&gt; to gather and analyze big and often semi- or unstructured data sets 
&gt; to develop and test communication science theories" 
&gt;
&gt;_Van Atteveldt &amp; Peng, 2018_

# Simulating search queries

- Numbers of drug-overdose deaths have been increasing in the United States.
- Google spotlights counselling services as helpful resources when users query for suicide-related search terms. 
- However, the search engine does so at varying display rates, depending on terms used
- Display rates in the drug-overdose deaths domain are unknown.
- Haim et al (2021) emulated suicide-related potentially harmful searches at large scale across the U.S. to explore Google’s response to search queries including or excluding additional drug-related terms

---

# Simulating behavior and analyzing responses

.pull-left[

- They conducted 215,999 search requests with varying combinations of search terms
- Counseling services were displayed at high rates after suicide-related potentially harmful search queries (e.g., “how to commit suicide”). 
- Display rates were substantially lower when drug-related terms, indicative of users’ suicidal overdosing tendencies, were added (e.g., “how to commit suicide fentanyl”)

# Analyzing and aggregating news coverage

.pull-left[
- Jacobi and colleagues analyzed the coverage of nuclear technology from 1945 to the present in the New York Times
- Analysis of 51,528 news stories (headline and lead): Way too much for human coding!
- Used "topic modelling" to extract latent topics and analyzed their occurence over time

# Analyzing gender representation in TV

- Jürgens et al (2021) investigated gender representations in over ten years of daytime TV programming
- Usually, this would have required hours and hours (!) of manual coding (i.e., watching a hell lot of TV)
- Instead, they used neural networks to detect gender in shown faces

![](img/juergen_face.png)
---

# Underrepresentation of women in German TV

.pull-left[
- Women on average remained underrepresented on TV, with 6.3 million female faces out of 16 million total
(estimated proportion .39, 95% CI: .37-.42)
- This strong overall bias was mirrored across specific subsamples (news, sports, advertising...)

# The trouble with 'R'

Shit, we have to learn a programming language?

# What is 'R'?

.pull-left[





```r
# Load package
library(ggplot2)

# Create vector
variable &lt;- rnorm(500, 2, 4)

# Plot Histogram
ggplot(NULL, 
       aes(variable)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                 fill = "lightblue")

# What is 'R' vs 'RStudio'?

### Basics

- R is a programming language, not just a software for statistical analyses
- Yet, primarily developed for conducting statistical analyses


### Infrastructure

- R is the programming language
- R shares some similarities with Python, S and Scheme
- RStudio is the software that is mostly used

---

# Advantages of R

### The future of scientific data analysis

- R is international and interdisciplinary
- Constant development and improvement by a huge online community
- Allows to work with complex and messy data structures

### Flexibility

- There are thousand additional packages for almost any statistical procedure
- Allows for flexible programming and is adaptive to own needs
- Encourages replicable analyses

---

# Advantages of R

### Graphic and other output possibilities

- Allows to produce publication-ready figures and visualizations
- Allows to combine analyses and writing to produces diverse output formats (e.g., these slides)

---

# Conclusion

### R allows...

- flexible and comprehensive programming
- complex data management
- advanced analyses with large or messy data
- to produce publication-ready figures and documents

### R encourages...

- reproducable and comprehensible analyses
- us to have fun with programming and coding!

## Practical sessions

- Course will be split in 5 groups
- Practical sessions take place twice a week
- Every Tuesday (either 9:00 to 10:30 or 11:00 to 12:30)
- Every Thursday (with 13.30 to 15:00 or 15:30 to 17:00)

*Note:* In cycle 3, you can choose one of the three alternatives. Yet, material will be provided for all specializations and you are encouraged to go through them by yourself. 
---

# Attendance

- Attendance during the regular lectures is **not compulsory** but highly recommended. 

- Attendance of the practical sessions is **mandatory**. One absence from one of the workgroup sessions, for serious health, family, or work reasons, can be excused if the instructor is advised in advance.  


---

# Exam

After the first two cycles, there will be a written exam (**70% of the final grade**):

- The exam will consist of ~60 multiple choice questions and ~6 open-ended questions
- Exam questions will be based on all material discussed in the first two cycles, including lecture content, class materials, and required readings.
- Example questions will be provided throughout the course. 
- Please register for the exam via VUweb. 


---

# Homework Assignment

After each week, students are required to hand in a “homework”, which represents a practical application of some of the taught analysis methods (e.g. with a new data set, specific research question) pass (**10% of the final grade**):

- Each week’s assignment requires students to apply the methods they have learned to a new data set. 
- Students will receive an RMarkdown template for their code and the respective data set(s).
- Students are required to hand in the RMarkdown file and a compiled html on Tuesday (24:00) the week after. All homework assignments must be submitted to pass. 

---

# Group presentation

During the third cycle, students will be assigned to small working groups in which they independently conduct a research project. The assignment requires them to present results from their working groups in a mini-conference. This presentation will be graded per group (**20% of the final grade**).

- Students need to prepare and give a 10-minute talk (including appropriate slides) in which they,
- introduce the research project (1-2 slides),
- describe theory and hypotheses (1 slide),
- explain the methods (1 slide),
- present the results (2 slides), and
- discuss the findings (1-2 slides).

Students are required to hand in the RMarkdown, a compiled output and the slides beforehand (Deadline: 19th of December 2021 at 12:00).
