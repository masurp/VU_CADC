# Example: Harnessing surprising sources of information

.pull-left[

- In 2009, Blumenstock and colleagues (2015, Science) wanted to study wealth and poverty in Rwanda. 

- They conducted a survey with a random sample of 1,000 customers of the largest mobile phone provider

- They collected demographics, social, and economic characteristics 

- Traditional social science survey, right?
]

--

.pull-right[
- The authors also had access to complete call records from 1.5 million people

- Combining both data sources, they used the survey data to "train" a machine learning model to predict a person's wealth based on their call records.

- They also estimated the places of residence based on the geographic information embedded in call records.

.pull-right[

- All together, they were able to produce a high-resolution map of the geographic distribution of wealth (and poverty) in Rwanda.

- Interesting side effect: Results were hard to validate - there were simply no comparable estimates for all geographic areas in Rwanda

.pull-right2[

- Already years ago, police departments have started to use a system called CRUSH (Criminal Reduction Utilizing Statistical History) 

- It evaluates patterns of past crime incidents and combines it with a range of data including crime reports, offender behavior profiles, or weather forecasts

- This combination of data is then used to predict potential hot spots and allocate resources to areas where particular crimes are most likely to occur.


]

# Why is this important now?

- In the past, collecting data was **expensive** (surveys, observations...)

- In the digital age, the behaviors of billions of people are **recorded**, **stored**, and therefore **analyzable**

- Every time you click on a website, make a call on your mobile phone, or pay for something with your credit card, a **digital record of your behavior** is created and stored

- Because (meta-)data are a byproduct of people’s everyday actions, they are often called **digital traces**

- Large-scale records of persons or business are often called **big data**.

# 10 Characteristics of Big Data

&lt;style&gt;
td {
  font-size: 22px
}
&lt;/style&gt;

|  |  Characteristic | Description |
| - | :----------- | :------------------------ | 
| 1 | Big | The scale or volume of some current datasets is often impressive. However, big datasets are not an end in themselves, but they can enable certain kinds of research including the study of rare events, the estimation of heterogeneity, and the detection of small differences |
| 2 | Always-on | Many big data systems are constantly collecting data and thus enable to study unexpected events and allow for real-time measurement  |
| 3 | Nonreactive | Participants are generally not aware that their data are being captured or they have become so accustomed to this data collection that it no longer changes their behavior. |
| 4 | Incomplete | Most big data sources are incomplete, in the sense that they don’t have the information that you will want for your research. This is a common feature of data that were created for purposes other than research. |
| 5 | Inaccessible | Data held by companies and governments are difficult for researchers to access. 
&lt;br&gt;

# 10 Characteristics of Big Data

|  |  Characteristic | Description |
| - | :----------- | :------------------------ | 
| 6 | Nonrepresentative | Most big datasets are nonetheless not representative of certain populations. Out-of-sample generalizations are hence difficult or impossible. |
| 7 | Drifting | Many big data systems are changing constantly, thus making it difficult to study long-term trends |
| 8 | Algorithmically confounded | Behavior in big data systems is not natural; it is driven by the engineering goals of the systems. |
| 9 | Dirty | Big data often includes a lot of noise (e.g., junk, spam, spurious data points...) |
| 10 | Sensitive | Some of the information that companies and governments have is sensitive. |

# Computational Communication Science

Why computational methods are important for (future) communication research. 

---

# Definition

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; "Computational Communication Science (CCS) is the label applied to the 
&gt; emerging subfield that investigates the use of computational algorithms 
&gt; to gather and analyze big and often semi- or unstructured data sets 
&gt; to develop and test communication science theories" 
&gt;
&gt;_Van Atteveldt &amp; Peng, 2018_

---

# Promises of computational communication research

The recent acceleration in the use of computational methods for communication
science is primarily fueled by the confluence of at least three developments:

- vast **amounts of digitally available data**, ranging from social media messages and other "digital" traces to web archives and newly digitized newspaper and other historical archives

- improved tools to analyze this data, including **network analysis methods** and **automatic text analysis methods** such as supervised **text classification**, **topic modelling**, **word embeddings**, and **syntactic methods**

- powerful and cheap **processing power**, and easy to use **computing infrastructure** for processing these data, including scientific and commercial cloud computing, sharing platforms such as Github and Dataverse, and crowd coding platforms such as
Amazon MTurk and Crowdflower

_Van Atteveldt &amp; Peng, 2017_

# Example: Simulating search queries

- Numbers of drug-overdose deaths have been increasing in the United States

- Google spotlights counselling services as helpful resources when users query for suicide-related search terms

- However, the search engine does so at varying display rates, depending on terms used

- Display rates in the drug-overdose deaths domain are unknown

- Haim and colleagues (2021) emulated suicide-related potentially harmful searches at large scale across the U.S. to explore Google’s response to search queries including or excluding additional drug-related terms

&lt;br&gt;

_Haim, Scherr, &amp; Arendt, 2021_

---

# Simulating behavior and analyzing responses

.pull-left[

- They conducted 215,999 search requests with varying combinations of search terms

- Counseling services were displayed at high rates after suicide-related potentially harmful search queries (e.g., “how to commit suicide”)

- Display rates were substantially lower when drug-related terms, indicative of users’ suicidal overdosing tendencies, were added (e.g., “how to commit suicide fentanyl”)

# Example: Analyzing and aggregating news coverage

.pull-left[
- Jacobi and colleagues (2016) analyzed the coverage of nuclear technology from 1945 to the present in the New York Times

- Analysis of 51,528 news stories (headline and lead): Way too much for human coding!

- Used "topic modelling" to extract latent topics and analyzed their occurence over time

# Example: Analyzing gender representation in TV

- Jürgens et al (2021) investigated gender representations in over ten years of daytime TV programming

- Usually, this would have required hours and hours (!) of manual coding (i.e., watching a hell lot of TV), but they used neural networks to automatically detect gender in shown faces

![](img/juergen_face.png)


---

# Underrepresentation of women in German TV

.pull-left[
- Women on average remained underrepresented on TV, with 6.3 million female faces out of 16 million total (estimated proportion .39, 95% CI: .37-.42)

- This strong overall bias was mirrored across specific subsamples (news, sports, advertising...)

# Ethics of 'Big Data' and Computational Research

.pull-left3[

&lt;p style = "background: #c3dbe6; padding: 10px; height: 8em; "&gt;

700,000 Facebook users were put into an experiment that may have altered their emotions. The participants did not give consent and the study was not subject to third party ethical oversight (Kramer et al., 2014)

&lt;/p&gt;

]

.pull-left3[

&lt;p style = "background: #c3dbe6; padding: 10px; height: 8em;"&gt;

Researcher scraped students' data from Facebook, merged it with university records, used these data for research and then shared them with other researchers (Wimmer &amp; Lewis, 2010).

&lt;/p&gt;

]

--

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

**Question:** Do you think these studies are problematic? If yes, why?

---

# Ethical problems

- More power over participants than in the past

- Guiding principles

    - **Respect for persons:** Treating people as autonomous and honoring their wishes
    - **Beneficence:** Understanding and improving the risk/benefit profile of a study
    - **Justice:** Risks and benefits should be evenly distributed
    - **Respect for law and public interest**


&lt;br&gt;

# Preliminary summary

.pull-left2[

![](img/pexels-omkar-patyane-238480.jpg)
]

.pull-right2[

- Computational communication research holds **manifold promises**

- We can harness unusual sources of information and **large amounts of data**, particularly because people constantly leave **digital traces**

- New methods allow to **structure**, **aggregate** and **make sense** of these data and extract meaningful information to study communication behavior and phenomena

- However, computational communication research comes with **ethical challenges** related to consent, privacy, and autonomy of the participants
