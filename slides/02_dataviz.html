# 1. Importing data

.pull-left[
- Data comes in different forms (two- or multidimensional, text or numbers...) and formats (.csv, .txt, .sav, .stata, .html...)

- Firs, we must hence find a way to import this data into R

- This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API), and load it into a data frame in R

- Imagine we would have found the following table on wikipedia and would want to get it into R...

# 1. Importing data: Scraping a webpage

- There is indeed an R-package that can download the entire html and css code of a website

- The resulting object, however, is not really in a tidy format





```r
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
wikipage &lt;- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory")
wikipage
```

```
{html_document}

# 2. Tidy

- Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored. 

- In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation.


```r
tidy_covid &lt;- wikipage %&gt;%
  html_element(xpath = ".//*[contains(@id, 'table65150380')]") %&gt;%   # extracting the right html table
  html_table(fill = T) %&gt;%                                           # transform into a tibble
  dplyr::select(2:5)                                                 # remove unnecessary columns
head(tidy_covid)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 4
  Country                `Deaths/million` Deaths    Cases      
  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;

2 Peru                   5,989            199,816   2,189,165  
3 Bosnia and Herzegovina 3,404            11,110    243,914

# 3. Transform


```r
subset_covid &lt;- tidy_covid %&gt;% 
  mutate(Deaths_million = as.numeric(gsub(",","",`Deaths/million`)),  # transform character into numeric values
         Deaths = as.numeric(gsub(",","", Deaths)),
         Cases = as.numeric(gsub(",","", Cases)),
         Mortality = (Deaths/Cases)*100) %&gt;%                          # estimate mortality
  filter(Country %in% c("United States", "Germany",                   # filter specific countries
                        "Netherlands", "United Kingdom",

# 5. Model 

- Once we have made our research questions sufficiently precise, we can use a model to answer them (remember P1?) 

- Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well 

- But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. 

---

# 6. Communicate

- A critical part of any data analysis project is "communication"

- It doesn’t matter how well our models and visualisation have led us to understand the data unless we can also communicate your results to others.

- Because of the crucial role of data visualization, we will discuss principles and aspects of it in more detail!

# Why we should look at data.

When data visualization is useful (and when it is not). 

---

# Anscombe's Quartett 

.pull-left[
- This quartett (Anscombe, 1973; Chatterjee &amp; Firat, 2007) presents a good argument for looking at data in visual form. 

- A series of four scatterplots show the relationship between two quantities, such as height and weight, age and income, or time and unemployment.

- Catch: The numerical properties of each pair of x and y variables are identical.

- But when visualized as a scatterplot, plotting the x variables on the horizontal axis and the y variable on the vertical, the differences between them are readily apparent.

# Perception and visual decoding

# Edges, Contrast, and Colors

.pull-left[
- Looking at figures means looking at lines, shapes, and colors

- But due to our visual systems, some things are easier for us to see than others

- Sometimes, we perceive differences where there actually none

# Contrast

.pull-left2b[

- Herman Grid Effect

- Ghostly blobs seem to appear at the intersections in the grid but only as long as one is not looking at them directly

- Our visual system is attracted to edges, and we assess contrast and brightness in terms of relative rather than absolute values

# Visual decoding

- In the 1980s, Cleveland and McGill conducted some experiments identifying and ranking theses tasks for different types of graphics


![](https://socviz.co/assets/ch-01-cleveland-task-types.png)

- Participatns were asked to estimate two values within a chart (e.g., two bars in a bar chart, or two slices of a pie chart), or compare values between charts (e.g. two areas in adjacent stacked bar charts).

_Cleveland &amp; McGill, 1984, 1987_

---

# Visual decoding task results

.pull-left2b[

- performance declined as we move away from comparison on a common scale to length-based comparisons to angles and finally areas

- Area comparisons perform even worse than the often criticized pie chart!

# Principles of Data Visualization

Some guidelines to work with

---

# Some words of caution

- As we've seen, some visualizations are better than others

- But the process of making a really good or really useful figure cannot be boiled down to a list of simple rules

- Even though guidelines exists (and we will discuss them), they should not be followed in all circumstances

- Some visualizations work well because they depend in part on some strong aesthetic judgments about what will be effective, but that sort of good judgment is hard to systematize

- However, data visualization is not simply a matter of competing standards of good taste

- Some approaches work better for reasons that have to do more to do with how human visual perception works.

# "Tell the truth" and "Show as much data as possible"

.pull-left[
![](img/alldata.gif)
]

.pull-right[

- these two principles were advocated by Edward Tufte (1983), a pioneer in data visualization

- like any descriptive statistic, data visualization is a *simplification* of your data and they can mask meaningful underlying variation

- to the extent that you include more fine-grained information, you can better convey the actual patterns within your data

]

_Hehman &amp; Xie, 2021_

---

# Tell the truth

.pull-left[
![](img/piechart.jpeg)
]

.pull-left[

- Graphs and figures should **always** be based on real data




]
---

# Keep it simple - minimalism

.pull-left[

- Overwhelmingly complex figures impede the overarching goal of science communication: to convey information clearly!

- Signal-to-noise ratio: signal is the information being conveyed and noise is anything else

- Features not conveying information or allowing readers to assess the patterns more easily should be removed (e.g., excessive grid lines, unncessary colorization...)

# Don't inverse charts

.pull-left[
![](img/gun_deaths.jpg)
]

.pull-right[

- Inversing is problematic because the figure thereby becomes counter-intuitive

- On first impression, it looks like that the "Stand your ground"-Law enactement reduced the number of gun deaths. Yet, the opposite is true!

]

---

# Don't truncate chart axes

.pull-left[

- Truncating a chart axis refers to showing only a small part of the entire axis

- Here, we see only values between 58% and 78%

- The difference would look less strong, if the axis would range from 0 to 100%

# Embellishment

- Generally speaking, we want to make a graph as clear as possible

- Embellishment can be distracting and deceiving

- However, it may increase recall 

- If done right, it can help to gain attention and increase recall!

# Label your figure correctly

.pull-left[

- Always include axes

- Always label axes

- Provide a meaningful title

- If needed: Provide an explanation for how to read the figure in a note!
