# 1. Importing data

.pull-left[
- Data comes in different forms (two- or multidimensional, text or numbers...) and formats (.csv, .txt, .sav, .stata, .html...)

- First, we must find a way to import this data into R

- This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API), and load it into a data frame in R

- Imagine we would have found the following table on wikipedia and would want to get it into R...

# 1. Importing data: Scraping a webpage

- There is indeed an R-package that can download the entire html and css code of a website

- The resulting object, however, is not really in a tidy format





```r
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
wikipage &lt;- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory")
wikipage
```

```
{html_document}

# 2. Tidy

- Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the data set with the way it is stored. 

- In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation.


```r
tidy_covid &lt;- wikipage %&gt;%
  html_element(xpath = ".//*[contains(@id, 'table65150380')]") %&gt;%   # extracting the right html table
  html_table(fill = T) %&gt;%                                           # transform into a tibble
  dplyr::select(2:5)                                                 # remove unnecessary columns
head(tidy_covid)
```

```
# A tibble: 6 x 4
  Country                `Deaths/million` Deaths    Cases      
  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;

# 3. Transform

         Deaths = as.numeric(gsub(",","", Deaths)),
         Cases = as.numeric(gsub(",","", Cases)),
         Mortality = (Deaths/Cases)*100) %&gt;%                          # estimate mortality
  filter(Country %in% c("United States", "Germany",                   # filter specific countries
                        "Netherlands", "United Kingdom",

# 5. Model 

- Once we have made our research questions sufficiently precise, we can use a model to answer them (remember P1?) 

- Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well 

- But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions 


---

# 6. Communicate

- A critical part of any data analysis project is "communication"

- It does not matter how well our models and visualizations have led us to understand the data unless we can also communicate your results to others

- Because of the crucial role of data visualization, we will discuss principles and aspects of it in more detail

# Anscombe's Quartett 

.pull-left[
- This quartett (Anscombe, 1973; Chatterjee &amp; Firat, 2007) presents a good argument for looking at data in visual form

- A series of four scatterplots show the relationship between two quantities, such as height and weight, age and income, or time and unemployment

- Catch: The numerical properties of each pair of x and y variables are identical

- But when visualized as a scatterplot, plotting the x variables on the horizontal axis and the y variable on the vertical, the differences between them are readily apparent

# Histogram: Summary

- Histograms demonstrate how many of a certain type of variable occur within a specific range

- The variable is cut into several bins, and the number of observation per bin is represented by the height of the bar

- They thus are an accurate graphical representation of the distribution of *numeric* data

--

### When to use?

- When the underlying variable is numerical

- When you want to see the shape of the data's distribution, especially when determining whether the variable is normally distributed

---

# Boxplot: Summary

- A boxplot gives a summary of one or more numeric variables (including median, interquartile range, extremes, and outliers)

- It thereby provides a visual representation of a distribution without showing the raw data

- Often used to show group differences

--

## When to use?

- When the independent variable is categorical and the dependent variable is numerical

- To highlight differences without loosing too much information (e.g., variance in the data)

- Very important first step to understand the raw data (helps to spot problems)

# Short reminder: Whast is a 95% confidence interval?


.pull-left2[

![](img/cis.png)

]

.pull-right2[

- Confidence intervals are often used as an alternative to standard null-hypothesis testing (i.e., the p-value)

- Confidence intervals describe the range of possible values for an unknown parameter (e.g., a population mean)

- Depending on the level of significance, we call it a (1-alpha)% confidence interval

- In this case, if we would run the experiment again with random samples from the population, 95% of the times, we would find a mean that lies within this range
]

---

# Bar chart with CIs: Summary

- In most experimental research, we want to visualize differences between groups (e.g., an experimental and a control group)

- A simply bar chart can highlight these difference by comparing the height of the bars

- Adding 95% confidence intervals provides a visual representation of the significance test (i.e., when the intervals of two groups do not overlap, the difference can be considered statistically significant)


--

### When to use?

- When the independent variable is categorical and the dependent variable is numerical

- To highlight differences between groups (despite loosing some information)

- To visualize statistical signficance

# Scatterplot: Summary

- A scatterplot displays the relationship between 2 numeric variables

- For each data point, the value of its first variable is represented on the X axis, the second on the Y axis

--

### When to use?

- A scatterplot is mostly used to study the relationship between 2 variables. It is thus often accompanied by a correlation or regression coefficient calculation, thattries to estimate the size of a linear relationship.

- However, this visualization can be used to detect other types of relationships (e.g., curvilinear, exponential...; see Ancombe's Quartett)

- Visualizing relationships can be a very helpful tool during the data analysis (e.g., to spot problems)

---

# Time series: Line plot

&lt;img src="02_dataviz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;

---

# Line plot: Summary

- A line chart or line graph displays the evolution of one or several numeric variables

- Data points are connected by a straight line 

- It is similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value)

--

### When to use?

- A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time (a time series)


---

# Visualizing results: Coefficient plots


![](img/casasetal_cis.png)


_Casas &amp; Williams, 2019_

---

# Coefficient plots: Summary

- A so-called coefficient plots visualizes results of (regression) models by plotting the estimate (point) and its confidence intervals (line around point)

- It often helps to reduce the complexity of a regression table and highlight differences between predictors


--

### When to use?

- To visualize complex model results 

- To highlight differences across predictors (e.g., whether predictor is stronger than another)

---

# Multiple groups: Facetting

&lt;img src="02_dataviz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;

---

# Facetted plots: Summary

- Sometimes data may be hierarchical, i.e., units are nested within groups

- In such cases, it can be meaningful to plot so-called "facets", that is the same representation of e.g., a relationship across several groups

--

### When to use?

- To highlight differences between higher-level groups (e.g., countries in continents, pupils in schools, articles in newspapers,...)

# Edges, Contrast, and Colors

# Contrast

.pull-left2b[

- Herman Grid Effect

- Ghostly blobs seem to appear at the intersections in the grid but only as long as one is not looking at them directly

- Our visual system is attracted to edges, and we assess contrast and brightness in terms of relative rather than absolute values

# Visual decoding

- In the 1980s, Cleveland and McGill conducted some experiments identifying and ranking theses tasks for different types of graphics


![](https://socviz.co/assets/ch-01-cleveland-task-types.png)

- Participants were asked to estimate two values within a chart (e.g., two bars in a bar chart, or two slices of a pie chart), or compare values between charts (e.g. two areas in adjacent stacked bar charts).

_Cleveland &amp; McGill, 1984, 1987_

# Visual decoding task results

.pull-left2b[

- Performance declined as we move away from comparison on a common scale to length-based comparisons to angles and finally areas

- Area comparisons perform even worse than the often criticized pie chart

# Principles of Data Visualization

Some guidelines to work with. 

---

# Some words of caution

- As we've seen, some visualizations are better than others

- But the process of making a really good or really useful figure cannot be boiled down to a list of simple rules

- Even though guidelines exists (and we will discuss them), they should not be followed in all circumstances

- Some visualizations work well because they depend in part on some strong aesthetic judgments about what will be effective, but that sort of good judgment is hard to systematize

- However, data visualization is not simply a matter of competing standards of good taste

- Some approaches work better for reasons that have to do more to do with how human visual perception works.

&lt;br&gt;

_Healy, 2019, chap. 1_

# Show as much data as possible

.pull-left[
![](img/alldata.gif)
]

.pull-right[

- these two principles were advocated by Edward Tufte (1983), a pioneer in data visualization

- like any descriptive statistic, data visualization is a *simplification* of your data and they can mask meaningful underlying variation

- to the extent that you include more fine-grained information, you can better convey the actual patterns within your data

]

_Hehman &amp; Xie, 2021_

---

# Tell the truth

.pull-left[
![](img/piechart.jpeg)
]

.pull-left[

- Graphs and figures should always be based on real data and should not just be "approximated"

- In the example on the left, the percentages do not correspond to the actual areas in the pie chart

- Even worse: the percentages do not add up to 100%

- We produce figures from data, not data that "roughly" aligns with the data!


]
---

# Keep it simple

.pull-left[

- Overwhelmingly complex figures impede the overarching goal of science communication: to convey information clearly!

- Signal-to-noise ratio: signal is the information being conveyed and noise is anything else

- Features not conveying information or allowing readers to assess the patterns more easily should be removed (e.g., excessive grid lines, unnecessary colorization...)

- Inversion is problematic because the figure thereby becomes counter-intuitive

- It almost looks like the enactment of the "Stand Your Ground" law lowered gun deaths - the opposite is true!

---

# Don't truncate chart axes

.pull-left[

- Truncating a chart axis refers to showing only a small part of the entire axis

- Here, we see only values between 58% and 78%

- The difference would look less strong, if the axis would range from 0 to 100%

# Embellishment

- Generally speaking, we want to make a graph as clear as possible

- Embellishment can be distracting and deceiving

- However, it may increase recall 

- If done right, it can help to gain attention and help people to remember the figure

---

# Label your figure correctly

.pull-left2c[

- **title** - a clear short title letting the reader know what they’re looking at
    - e.g., *Relationship between experience and social media literacy by gender*
- **subtitle** - an optional second (smaller font) title giving additional information
    - e.g., *Years 2016-2018*
- **caption** - source attribution for the data
    - e.g., *source: US Department of Labor - www.bls.gov/bls/blswage.htm*
- **axis labels** - clear labels for the x and y axes
    - short but descriptive
    - include units of measurement
        - e.g., *Internet use (minutes per day)*
- **legend** - short informative title and labels
    - e.g., *Male and Female* (not 0 and 1)
- **lines and bars** - label any trend lines, annotation lines, and error bars

# Conclusion

.pull-left[

**1.** Tell the truth

**2.** Show as much data as possible

**3.** Keep it simple

**4.** Do not inverse charts

**5.** Do not truncate chart axes

]

.pull-right[

**6.** Find the right aspect-ratio

**7.** Maximize data-ink ratio (but not too much!)

**8.** Be clear about uncertainty

**9.** Be careful with embellishment

**10.** Label your axes and figure

# A Layered Grammar of Graphics

.pull-left[

- In R, we mostly use the package **ggplot2** to plot graphs and figures

- It uses a layered grammar of graphics, i.e., each part of a figure (coordinate system, plot annotations, geometrical objects, aesthetics...) are an individual layer that can be added and removed.

- Understanding this grammar is powerful for creating great visualizations

# Conclusion

- Data visualization is a powerful tool

- A lot of times, we can convey insights better in charts or figures

- However, there are many caveats and sometimes a classic results table does the job

- The appropriate graph is always determined by the *type of data* and the *context*/*research question*

- In the next practical session(s), we will learn how to produce nice figures in R!
