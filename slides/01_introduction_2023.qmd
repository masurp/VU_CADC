# What is Computational Social Science? {background-color="steelblue"}

...and why should we care?

## Example: Surprising Sources of Information

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-   In 2009, researchers wanted to study wealth and poverty in Rwanda

-   They conducted a survey with a random sample of 1,000 customers of the largest mobile phone provider

-   They collected demographics, social, and economic characteristics (incl. wealth)

-   So far, traditional social science, right?
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
-   The authors also had access to complete call records from 1.5 million people

-   Combining both data sources, they used the survey data to "train" a machine learning model to predict a person's wealth based on their call records

-   They also estimated the places of residence based on the geographic information embedded in call records

## Computational Social Science

-   Field of social science that uses algorithmic tools and large/unstructured data to understand human and social behavior

-   Complements rather than replaces traditional methodologies: Methods are not the goal, but contribute to data generation

-   Includes methods such as, e.g.,:

    -   Data mining (e.g., scraping and gathering of large data sets)
    -   Software development for social science experiments
    -   Automated text analysis (e.g., sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, dictionary approaches)
    -   Image classification (e.g., face recognition, visual topic modeling)
    -   Machine learning approaches (e.g., for classification, prediction, topic modeling)
    -   Actor-based modeling (e.g., simulation of social behavior, spreading of information)
    -   ...

## Why is this important now?

-   Vast **amounts of digitally available data**, ranging from social media messages and other digital traces to web archives and newly digitized newspaper and other historical archives

-   Large-scale records (**big data**) of persons or businesses are created constantly

-   Powerful and comparatively cheap **processing power**, and easy to use **computing infrastructure** for processing these data

-   Improved **tools to analyze** this data, including network analysis methods and automatic text analysis methods such as supervised text classification, topic modeling, word embeddings, as well as large language models

|-----------|:----------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Big            | The scale or volume of some current data sets is often impressive. However, big data sets are not an end in themselves, but they can enable certain kinds of research including the study of rare events, the estimation of heterogeneity, and the detection of small differences |
| 2   | Always-on      | Many big data systems are constantly collecting data and thus enable to study unexpected events and allow for real-time measurement                                                                                                                                             |
| 3   | Nonreactive    | Participants are generally not aware that their data are being captured or they have become so accustomed to this data collection that it no longer changes their behavior.                                                                                                     |
| 4   | Incomplete     | Most big data sources are incomplete, in the sense that they don't have the information that you will want for your research. This is a common feature of data that were created for purposes other than research.                                                              |
| 5   | Inaccessible   | Data held by companies and governments are difficult for researchers to access.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|------------|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------|
| 6   | Nonrepresentative              | Most big datasets are nonetheless not representative of certain populations. Out-of-sample generalizations are hence difficult or impossible. |
| 7   | Drifting                       | Many big data systems are changing constantly, thus making it difficult to study long-term trends                                             |
| 8   | Algorithmically <br>confounded | Behavior in big data systems is not natural; it is driven by the engineering goals of the systems.                                            |
| 9   | Dirty                          | Big data often includes a lot of noise (e.g., junk, spam, spurious data points...)                                                            |
| 10  | Sensitive                      | Some of the information that companies and governments have is sensitive.                                                                     |

## Typical research areas

::: columns
::: {.column width="47.5%"}
Computational communication science studies thus usually involve:

(1) large and complex data set
(2) consisting of digital traces and other "naturally occurring" data
(3) requiring algorithmic solutions to analyze
(4) allowing the study of human communication by applying and testing communication theory

-   Political Communication

    -   Democratization and Polarization
    -   Hate Speech

-   Social Media Use

    -   Tracking of actual social media use
    -   Spreading of behavior, information, or emotions

-   Health Communication

    -   Prevalence of health information online

-   (Online) Journalism

    -   News coverage across decaces
    -   Gender equality
:::

## Example 1: Analyzing News Coverage

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}

-   Jacobi and colleagues (2016) analyzed the coverage of nuclear technology from 1945 to 2014 in the New York Times

-   Analysis of 51,528 news stories (headline and lead): Way too much for human coding!

-   Used "LDA topic modeling" to extract latent topics and analyzed their occurrence over time

## Example 2: Facebook Data to Predict Personality

- Kosinski and colleagues (2013) used a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric test

- Were able to show that one can predict a variety of personal characteristics and personality traits from simple Facebook likes

-   Simon et al. (2022) collected the full messaging history (N = 2,033,661) of 174 Dutch-language public Telegram chats/channels

-   Used state-of-the-art web-mining, neural topic modeling, and social network analysis techniques

-   Their findings raise concerns with respect to Telegram's polarization and radicalization capacity

-   They observed that Telegram users are active in and share content across different communities (see Figure on the right)

## Example 4: Gender Stereotypes in Political News

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Andrich et al (2023) studied gender differences in political news coverage to determine whether the media employ stereotypical traits in portrayals of 1,095 U.S. politicians

- The sample consisted of over 5 million U.S. news stories published from 2010 to 2020



:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](img/andrich_fig1.jpeg)
:::
:::

- They studied the media’s attribution of gender-linked (feminine, masculine) and political (leadership, competence, integrity, empathy) traits to U.S. politicians


- All three masculine traits were more strongly associated with male politicians, but only the feminine physical traits were more strongly associated with female politicians

## Example 5: Gender representation in TV

-   Jürgens and colleagues (2021) investigated gender representations in over ten years of daytime TV programming

-   Usually, this would have required hours and hours (!) of manual coding (i.e., watching a hell lot of TV), but they used neural networks to automatically detect gender in shown faces

![](img/juergen_face.png)

## Example 5: Gender representation in TV

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Women on average remained underrepresented on TV, with 6.3 million female faces out of 16 million total (estimated proportion .39, 95% CI: .37-.42)

-   This strong overall bias was mirrored across specific subsamples (news, sports, advertising...)

# Ethics of Computational Communication Research {background-color="steelblue"}

Ethical challenges in using computational methods

## Two (un-)ethical studies?

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {style="background: #c3dbe6; padding: 15px; height: 10em; "}
700,000 Facebook users were put into an experiment that may have altered their emotions. The participants did not give consent and the study was not subject to third party ethical oversight (Kramer et al., 2014)
:::
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}

::: {style="background: #c3dbe6; padding: 15px; height: 10em;"}
Researcher scraped students' data from Facebook, merged it with university records, used these data for research and then shared them with other researchers (Wimmer & Lewis, 2010).
:::
:::

. . .

<br>

**Question:** Do you think these studies are problematic? If yes, why?

## The "Facebook mood manipulation" study

-   Massive online experiment (N \~ 700k)

-   Main Research Question: Is emotion contagious?

-   Experimental groups: positive / negative / control

-   Stimulus: Hide (negative / positive / random) messages from FB timeline

-   Measurement / dependent variables: sentiment of posts by user

## Computational Method: Sentiment Analysis

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-   LIWC word list (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count; Pennebaker et al.)

    -   406 positive words: e.g., love, nice, sweet, etc.

    -   399 negative words: e.g. hurt, ugly, nasty

-   Count occurrences of words in both categories, subtract negative from positive

## Is this good science? Why not?

. . .

-   Positive aspects
    -   Potentially interesting research question
    -   Actual behavior measured as well as self-report measures

. . .

-   Problematic aspects
    -   Not replicable
    -   Low internal validity (sentiment even indicative of mood?)
    -   Low measurement accuracy (are word counts indicative of sentiment?)

. . .

-   Ethical issues
    -   Overt manipulation of people's life
    -   No informed consent and no debriefing

## Ethical challenges in computational research (1)

1. **Privacy and Data Security:** A key ethical concern is the handling of personal data, including the risk of data breaches and misuse. When using proprietary software/algorithms, should we share personal data with the company behind it (e.g., OpenAI, Google)?

2. **Bias and Fairness:** Computational methods can inherit biases from the data they are trained on. This can result in unfair or discriminatory outcomes, especially when later applied to contexts like hiring, lending, and criminal justice. Addressing these biases remains an ongoing challenge. Validation is of utmost importance!

3. **Transparency and Accountability:** Many computational algorithms are complex and not easily understandable by humans. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to hold individuals or organizations accountable for the decisions made by these algorithms. Lack of explainability can lead to a lack of trust.

4. **Social Manipulation:** Computational methods can be used to manipulate public opinion or behavior, often in unethical ways (see Kramer et al.). This includes spreading misinformation or conducting social experiments without consent and debriefing.


## Ethical challenges in computational research (2)


5. **Environmental Impact:** The massive computational power required for some methods, such as training deep learning models, can have a significant environmental impact, contributing to concerns about energy consumption and climate change.

6. **Ownership and Intellectual Property:** Questions of intellectual property rights, data and model ownership, and access to computational methods can raise more ethical issues. Some may argue that access to certain methods should be open to all (see also point 3 transparency), while others may seek to protect intellectual property (among other things, to e.g., prevent misuse).

7. **Ethical AI:** In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, ethical concerns often revolve around the development of AI systems that can make autonomous decisions. Ensuring these decisions align with human values is a significant challenge. Ethical dilemmas arise around the degree of control we should and are able to maintain over these systems and who should be responsible for their actions.

<br>

[see also van Atteveldt & Peng, 2018]{style="font-size:0.65em;"}

## General ethical guidelines

Salganik (2013) proposes the following four ethical guidelines for evaluating the ethical nature of a computational study. They are loosely based on the Belmont Report (1978), which is a fundamental document in prescribing ethical guidelines for the protection of human subjects of research:

-   **Respect for persons:** Treating people as autonomous and honoring their wishes

-   **Beneficence:** Understanding and improving the risk/benefit profile of a study

-   **Justice:** Risks and benefits should be evenly distributed among participants/research subjects

-   **Respect for law and public interest**: Respect privacy, copyright, and access rights

This is not to cast aspersions on the scientific rigour or value of these accounts. It is simply to observe that the two fulfil somewhat similar functions. If we think on a scale of, say, the last 3m years, there actually was a time when someone, after all, did have to light a fire, cook a meal or perform a marriage ceremony for the first time. We know these things happened. Still, we really don’t know how. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to make up stories about what might have happened: stories which necessarily reflect our own fears, desires, obsessions and concerns. As a result, such distant times can become a vast canvas for the working out of our collective fantasies.")) %>%

## Symbols and Meaning

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ziF48659L._AC_UF350,350_QL50_.jpg){.absolute top=140 right=0 width="400"}


-   Text consists of *symbols*

-   Symbols by themselves do not have meaning

-   A symbol itself is a mark, sign, or word that indicates, <br> signifies, or is understood as representing an idea, <br>object, or relationship

-   Symbols thereby allow people to go beyond what is <br>known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise <br>very different concepts and experiences

-   Text (a collection of symbols) only attains meaning <br>when interpreted (in its context)

-   Main challenge in Automatic Text Analysis:<br> Bridge the gap from symbols to meaningful<br> interpretation

## Understanding language

![](img/hvitfeld_book.png){style="float: right; padding-left: 40px;" width="300"}

> "As natural language processing (NLP) practitioners, we bring our assumptions about what language is and how language works into the task of creating modeling features from natural language and using those features as inputs to statistical models. This is true even when we don't think about how language works very deeply or when our understanding is unsophisticated or inaccurate \[...\] We can improve our machine learning models for text by heightening that knowledge."

[Hvitfeldt & Silge, 2021]{style="font-size:0.85em;"}

## A short overview of linguistics

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-   Each field studies a *different level* at which language exhibits organization

-   When we engage in text analysis, we use these levels of organization to create language features (e.g., tokens, n-grams,...)

-   They often depend on the morphological characteristics of language, such as when text is broken into sequences of characters, words, sentences

## Morphology

-   When we build text classification models for text data, we use these levels of organization to create natural language features (i.e. predictors for our models)

-   What features we extract often depend on the morphological characteristics of language, such as when text is broken into sequences of characters

-   Yet, because the organization and the rules of language can be ambiguous, our ability to create text features for machine learning is constrained by the very nature of language

# General Text Classification Workflow {background-color="steelblue"}

A Framework for this Course

## General Text Classification Pipeline

![](img/text_analysis_fundamentals/Slide01a.png)

-   **General Goal:** to label (or annotate) previously unlabeled text

    - Entails labeling a sentence, paragraph, or entire text (e.g., with the topic, the sentiment,...)
    - Specific methods may differ, but the necessary steps (1-4) usually remain the same
    
- We will always come back to this general pipeline to make sure we understand the core principles and goals

## (1) Obtaining text

![](img/text_analysis_fundamentals/obtainging_text.png){.absolute top="30" right="0" width="350"}

-   Publicly available data sets

    -   e.g.: Political texts, news from publisher / library
    -   Great if you can find it, often not available

-   Scraping primary sources

    -   e.g.: Press releases from party website, existing archives
    -   Writing scrapers can be trivial or very complex depending on web site
    -   Make sure to check legal issues

-   Proprietary texts from third parties

    -   e.g.: digital archives (LexisNexis, factiva etc.), social media APIs
    -   Often custom format, API restrictions, API changes
    -   Terms of use not conducive to research, sharing

## (2) Feature engineering

![](img/text_analysis_fundamentals/feature_engineering.png){.absolute top="30" right="0" width="320"}

-   Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, <br> and transforming raw data into so-called features

-   What type of feature engineering is necessary or useful <br> strongly depends on the method used, but may include

    -   **feature creation:** breaking down text into the features that we want to analyze (so-called tokens such as words, sentence, bi-grams...)
    -   **feature transformation:** involves text cleaning such as stopword removal, stemming, normalization
    -   **feature selection:** frequency trimming
    -   **creation of structured data:** e.g., a document-feature matrix (for classic ML approaches)

-   Modern approaches such require less and less feature engineering and at times, make it entirely obsolete

## (3) Text classification

![](img/text_analysis_fundamentals/text_classification.png){.absolute top="0" right="0" width="300"}

<br>

![](img/approaches.png)

## (4) Validation

![](img/text_analysis_fundamentals/validation.png){.absolute top="10" right="0" width="260"}

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Many text analysis processes are 'black boxes'

    -   even manual coding
    -   dictionaries are ultimately opaque
    -   complex algorithms cannot be deciphered

-   Computer does not 'understand' natural language

    -   It just predicts labels based on features
    -   False-positive and false-negatives occur

-   We need to prove that the analysis is valid

    -   Validate by comparing text analyis output to a known good
    -   Reference: often manual annotation of a 'gold standard'

## A very small example

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| output-location: fragment
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| class-output: output
# Loading package
library(tidytext)

# Raw text
data <- tibble(
  docs = c(1:4),
  text = c("Computational methods include various approaches to text classification.",
           "Oppenheimer is a 2023 biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan.",
           "Communication Science analyzes contents, uses, and consequences of media and communication.",
           "Barbie is a 2023 fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig.")
  )

# Feature engineering
tokens <- data |> 
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
head(tokens, n = 10)

```

## A very simple example: Dictionary approach

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| class-output: output
#| output-location: fragment
# Creating a simple dictionary
dictionary <- tibble(movie = c("film", "movie"),
                     methods = c("methods", "science"))
print(dictionary)
```


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| class-output: output
#| output-location: fragment
# Text classification
tokens |>
  left_join(dictionary |>
  gather(label, word)) |>
  group_by(docs, label) |>
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  spread(label, n)
```

## Zero-shot classification with BERT transformer

```{r, echo = F}
load("data/results.RData")
```

```{r, eval = F}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| class-output: output
library(ccsamsterdamR)

# Test classification
results <- text_zeroshot(data$text, labels = c("movie", "methods", "science"),
                         url = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/bart-large-mnli")
results %>%
  unnest(cols = c("labels", "scores")) %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  spread(labels, scores)
```

```{r, echo = F}
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| class-output: output
#| output-location: fragment
results %>%
  unnest(cols = c("labels", "scores")) %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  spread(labels, scores)

## Course Schedule

![](img/schedule1.png)

## Course Schedule

![](img/schedule2.png)

## Attendance

You will realize that this course has a comparatively **steep learning curve**. We will learn about complex research papers and recreate their analyses in R. It is thus generally recommended to follow all lectures and practical sessions! Despite some initial challenges, you will also experience a lot of self-efficacy: Learning R and computational methods is very rewarding and at the end, you can be proud of what you have achieved!

<br>

-   Attendance during the regular lectures is highly recommended (this is the content for the exam).

-   Attendance of the practical sessions is **mandatory**.

-   One absence from one of the workgroup sessions, for serious health, family, or work reasons, can be excused if the instructor is advised **in advance**.

## Exam

After the first two cycles, there will be a written exam (**40% of the final grade**):

<br>

-   The exam will consist of \~28-36 multiple choice questions and \~6-10 open-ended questions

-   Exam questions will be based on **all material** discussed in the first two cycles, including lecture content, class materials, and required readings

-   Example questions will be provided throughout the course

-   Please register for the exam via VUweb

## Homework Assignments

After each week, students are required to hand in a "homework assignment", which represents a practical application of some of the taught analysis methods (e.g. with a new data set, specific research question) (**30% of the final grade**):

<br>

-   Each week's assignment requires students to apply the methods they have learned to a new data set.

-   Students will receive an RMarkdown template for their code and the respective data set(s), explanations for how to use these templates will be providee in the practical sessions and via Canvas.

-   Students are required to hand in the **RMarkdown file** (.rmd) and a compiled **html document** (.html) on Thursday (24:00, hard deadline!) the week after. All homework assignments must be submitted to pass!

-   Homework assignment will be graded as follows as *fail*, *pass* or *good*.

## Group presentation

In the third cycle, students will be assigned to small working groups in which they independently conduct a research project. A final presentation on the 18th of December (09.00 to 12.00) will be graded per group (**30% of the final grade**).

<br>

-   A 10-minute talk (including appropriate slides) in which you:
    -   introduce the research project (1-2 slides)
    -   describe theory and hypotheses (1 slide)
    -   explain the methods (1 slide)
    -   present the results (2 slides)
    -   discuss the findings (1-2 slides)

Students are required to hand in the slides (e.g., powerpoint) and analyses (again .rmd and .html) beforehand (Deadline: 17th of December 2021 at 24:00, hard deadline!)

## Example Exam Question (Open Format)

Name and explain two characteristics of big data.

*(4 points, 2 points for correctly naming them and 2 points for correctly explaining them)*

. . .

1.  Big data are often "incomplete": This means they do not have the information that you will want for your research. This is a common feature of data that were created for purposes other than research. For example, log data (e.g., browser history) includes all links a person has visited over time, but does not provide any additional information. More over, it may contain gaps where the software failed or the person purposefully hid his surfing behavior.

2.  Big data are often "algorithmically confounded": Behavior in big data systems is not natural; it is driven by the engineering goals of the systems. For example, what you see on a facebook news feed depends on algorithm that Facebook has built into their platform. Behavior of individuals is thus also driven by these system-immanent features.
